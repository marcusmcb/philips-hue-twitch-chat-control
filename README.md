# Philips Hue Twitch Chat Control

This repo contains code that can be used to control your local Philips Hue smart lighting via channel point redemptions with Twitch.

You'll need to register a new app to your Twitch developer console in order to generate the necessary client ID & secret to use this script.  You'll also need to do likewise within your Philips/Hue developer portal.
